An important factor in the choice of our new Collections Management System was that the new system had to be able to handle both the specimen metadata and all of our herbarium management functions. TEXPRESS was great for rapid data entry – if not for data quality – and it was to be expected that in any new system it would take longer to database a record than in TEXPRESS and we aimed to offset that – at least for the curation officers who do most of the databasing when we don't have special databasing projects going on – by increasing the efficiency of the administration of other herbarium tasks.")]),e._v(" "),o("p",[e._v("Specify is an off-the-shelf system that is meant to be suitable for all sorts of Natural History collections and therefore will never be able to do absolutely everything exactly the way individual collections want to. We chose between three existing collection management systems (EMu, BRAHMS and Specify), because we didn't have the resources or expertise to develop a CMS in-house, and we were willing to change some of our procedures in order to accommodate the new system. In the end I think the procedures we had to change were developed within the constraints of the old collections database and the new database enabled us to make our procedures more efficient, but some of our staff might disagree with that. While we now most definitely do have the expertise to develop our own system in-house, we think it is important that also the more resource-rich institutions – at least the ones that do not have large non-Natural History collections and therefore have to use general museum software like EMu – resist the temptation to develop their own perfect little systems, but keep conforming to the same general data model for Natural History collections. While we have developed several (internal) web-based applications around Specify, these are only to increase our efficiency. We have not made any changes to the Specify source code (of our instance) and have not changed anything to the database structure (we have added some extra indexes and are using some MySQL triggers). Almost exact copies of our Specify instance (without the data) are in use or being implemented at six Australian and New Zealand university herbaria, two of which already deliver their data to AVH.")]),e._v(" "),o("p",[e._v("The Interactions – which is what Specify calls transactions, possibly because 'transactions' in database language has its own meaning – seems to be the part of Specify that is most geared towards zoological rather than herbarium collections, which makes sense given that the developers of Specify are based at a Natural History museum and the Specify product manager is also the manager of the fish collections, and there are not many herbaria that have implemented Specify yet. Probably the main issue for herbaria is that our loans (and exchange) tend to be much bigger than those of musea – our loans often contain hundreds, sometimes over a thousand specimens – so we have a bigger need for efficiency and on the other hand are probably less variable in terms of preparation types, so we do not have the need of all the steps you have to go through now. Therefore, for herbaria, the way Interactions are implemented might seem rather cumbersome. We have made it work for us, but that is not to say that it cannot be improved. Specify Software has always been very good with taking our suggestions – they have also been very generous with their time to us – so I am sure that once more herbaria implement the Specify Interactions and we come up with some things that will make the Interactions work better for all herbaria, they'll be willing to make the necessary improvements.")]),e._v(" "),o("h2",{attrs:{id:"accessions"}},[o("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#accessions","aria-hidden":"true"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Accessions")]),e._v(" "),o("p",[e._v("We intended to use Accessions for our incoming exchange, but as in the old system the incoming exchange was not linked to Collection Objects, we made this a long-term goal and so far haven't come around to implementing it.")]),e._v(" "),o("p",[e._v("However, under the Nagoya Protocol, which Australia is a signatory of, from October this year we have to be able to supply permit information for all collections we send out of our country.
