## Conservator description form

The **Conservator description** table is used to record information about destructive sampling and damage occurring to specimens.

### Preparation

Select the preparation type that has been damaged or destructively sampled. If more than one preparation type of a specimen has been damaged or sampled from, a separate **Conservator description** will need to be entered for each preparation.

### Event type

Select the event type; the following values are currently available in the pick list:

-   Destructive sampling

-   Damage to specimen.

If a specimen has been subjected to more than one event type (i.e. has been both destructively sampled from *and* damage has occurred), a separate **Conservator description** record will need to be entered for each event.

### Events

The **Events** section of the **Conservator description** form is used to record the details of a single instance of damage or destructive sampling of a preparation. If the preparation has been damaged or sampled more than once (and if it is possible to distinguish between the different damage events), each instance of damage or destructive sampling should be treated as a separate event. The form is split into three sections: fields relevant to ‘Destructive sampling’ events, fields relevant to ‘Damage to specimen’ events, and fields relevant to both event types.

#### Researcher

The name of the person who has carried out the destructive sampling or on whose behalf destructive sampling was undertaken by a staff member.

#### Sampling date

The date the destructive sampling occurred. The sampling date can be entered as a full date (day, month and year), a month and year, or a year only. Select the date type from the date drop-down list, then enter the date using the number keys.

#### Purpose

The intended purpose of the destructive sampling (e.g. DNA sequencing, pollen sample, leaf cuticle analysis).

#### Results

A statement of the results of destructive sampling (e.g. whether DNA was successfully extracted). Information about DNA sequences (e.g. GenBank accession numbers) will be recorded in the **DNA sequence** table.

#### Cause of damage

The organism or event that damaged the specimen. The following values are currently available in the pick list (if another value needs to be added, see the Digital Collections Advisor):

-   beetle

-   cigarette beetle

-   fire

-   human

-   inadequate packaging

-   insect

-   mould

-   psocid

-   silverfish

-   unknown

-   water.

Where more than one option applies, always choose the most descriptive term, e.g. ‘silverfish’ rather than ‘insect’.

#### Severity

The severity of the damage to the specimen. The following values are available in the pick list:

-   minor

-   moderate

-   severe.

If different parts of the specimen have received different levels of damage (e.g. minor damage to stem and moderate damage to leaves), only enter the most severe category of damage present. If additional information about the severity of damage needs to be recorded, enter it in the **Comments** field.

#### Verbatim date noticed

If the date damage was noticed is given in a format that cannot be entered in the date field, it should be entered here (e.g. ‘late October’, ‘summer of 1964’). If the date noticed is given in a non-standard format but includes a year or a year and a month, the date should also be entered in the **Date noticed** field.

#### Date noticed

The date damage to the specimen was noticed. The date can be entered as a full date (day, month and year), a month and year, or a year only. Select the date type from the date drop-down list, then enter the date using the number keys.

#### Assessed by

The staff member who assessed the damage to a specimen.

#### Date assessed

The date on which damage to a specimen was assessed by a staff member. The date assessed can be entered as a full date (day, month and year), a month and year, or a year only. Select the date type from the date drop-down list, then enter the date using the number keys.

#### Treatment report

Information about the treatment provided to the specimen, such as the names of the agents or organisations providing the treatment, when the treatment occurred, a description of the treatment, and any notes about how the damage to the specimen has been documented.

#### Part of specimen

The part/s of the specimen that have been destructively sampled from or damaged. The value of the field can be one or more of the following (if more values need to be added, please see the Digital Collections Advisor):

-   alga

-   fungus

-   lichen

-   liverwort

-   moss

-   buds

-   inflorescence

-   fruit

-   cone

-   leaves

-   rhizome

-   roots

-   stem

-   bark

-   label

-   seeds

-   sori.

If more than one part of the specimen has been damaged, separate each part with a comma and a space, e.g. ‘stem, leaves’.

#### Comments

Any additional information about destructive sampling or damage to the specimen.

#### Conservator event attachments

Any attachments documenting the damage to the preparation.
