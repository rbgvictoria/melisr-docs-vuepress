## Label data

### Verbatim collectors

The collector(s) name(s) exactly as they appear on the label, without interpretation. If the label contains a collector’s name, you only need to complete this field if the names entered in the **Collectors** field have been interpreted, or if the name on the label is spelt differently or provides additional information, including honorifics (Miss, Mrs, Prof., Dr, Mr etc.). By recording the collector(s) name(s) verbatim, it is much easier to correct this information where the original interpretation of a name was incorrect, and it’s also enormously useful for historical research. Do not include collecting numbers in the **Verbatim collector** field.

If there is no collector’s name on the specimen, tick the **Collector unknown** box, but if the label actually states that the collector is unknown, enter ‘Unknown’ in the **Verbatim collector** field.

If there is more than one collector, but only one of the collectors’ names has been interpreted, you should still enter them both in the **Verbatim collector** field. For example, if the collectors were given as ‘Mr & Mrs T.P. Richards’, you would enter the collectors as ‘T.P. Richards’ and ‘A.F. Richards’, and the verbatim collectors would be recorded as ‘Mr & Mrs T.P. Richards’, not just ‘Mrs T.P. Richards’.

A guide to when the name on the label should be recorded in the **Verbatim collectors** field is provided below:

| **Name on label**   | **Collectors**     | **Record verbatim collector(s)?** |
|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Chas. Walter        | Walter, C.         | No – there is no interpretation, and the additional information on the label is not particularly important |
| Mrs T.P. Richards   | Richards, A.F.     | Yes – the name in the **Collector** field has been interpreted |
| O. Tepper           | Tepper, J.G.O.     | Yes – the name in the **Collector** field has been interpreted |
| Sir W. McGregor     | MacGregor, W.      | Yes – the name on the label is spelt differently to the interpreted name in the **Collector** field, and includes an honorific |
| Rev. J. Chalmers    | Chalmers, J.       | No – there is not really any interpretation of the name here. ‘Rev.’ will be recorded as the **Title** in the **Agent** record for James Chalmers. |
| Th. Kotschy         | Kotschy, C.G.T.    | Yes – the name in the **Collector** field has been interpreted |
| Dr Hooker           | Hooker, J.D.       | Yes – the name in the **Collector** field has been interpreted |
| Bowm.               | Bowman, E.         | Yes – the name in the **Collector** field has been interpreted |
| Fr. Nicolas         | Nicolas, G.        | Yes – ‘Fr.’ has been interpreted as a title, rather than an abbreviated first name |
| Thwaites            | Thwaites, G.H.K.   | Yes – the initials have been inferred |

### Collector inferred

If the collector has been inferred, tick the **Collector inferred** check box. Information about how the collector has been inferred can be entered in the **Miscellaneous notes** field, along with any relevant sources.

### Collector unknown

If there is no collector’s name on the sheet, and the collector cannot be inferred, tick the **Collector unknown** check box. ‘However, if the collecting label says ‘Unknown’, enter ‘Unknown’ in the **Verbatim collectors** field.

### Collector illegible

If the collector’s name is on the sheet, but is illegible, tick the **Illegible** check box.

### Verbatim collecting date

If the collecting date is given in a format that cannot be entered in the date field, it should be entered here (e.g. ‘late March’, ‘Spring’, ‘Christmas 1912’). If the collecting date is given in a non-standard form but includes a year, or a year and a month, the date should also be entered in the collecting date fields (**Start date** and **End date**).

### Date inferred

If the collecting date has been inferred, tick the **Date inferred** check box. Do not infer collecting dates from other database records; collecting dates should only be inferred from published sources, such as expedition journals, exsiccata lists or other publications.

Information about the source of an inferred date can be entered in the **Miscellaneous notes** field; however, if the date has been inferred from the collector’s lifespan or known period of activity, enter that information in the **Agent** table instead.

## Plant origin

### Introduced status

The introduced status of the specimen at the collecting locality. This information will either be provided by the collector, in the exchange data, or assessed by a botanist at a later date. Data entry staff do not need to assess introduced status. Where this information is provided by the collector or in the exchange data, enter the exact wording in the **Collecting notes** field, and select the corresponding category from the pick list. The following values can be selected from the pick list:

-   Native – the taxon is native to the collecting locality

-   Not native – the taxon is not native at the collecting locality

-   Unknown – the introduced status of the taxon at the collecting locality is unknown.

If the **Introduced status** field is filled in, the introduced **Source** field must also be completed.

### Introduced source

The source of the introduced status. The following values can be selected from the pick list:

-   Collector – the introduced status was provided by the collector

-   Exchange data – the introduced status was provided in the exchange data

-   JCR – the introduced status was assessed by John Reid

-   Label data – the introduced status appears on the original label, but it’s not clear that it was provided by the collector

-   NGW – the introduced status was assessed by Neville Walsh

-   VS – the introduced status was assessed by Val Stajsic.

If other values need to be added to the pick list, please see the Digital Collections Advisor.

### Introduced status date

The date that the introduced status was assessed, if known.

### Cultivated status

The cultivated status of the specimen at the collecting locality. This information will either be provided by the collector, in the exchange data, or assessed by a botanist at a later date. Data entry staff may also make an assessment of whether the specimen was ‘Presumably cultivated’ or ‘Possibly cultivated’ if the collecting information is ambiguous, but do not need to assess the cultivated status otherwise. Where this information is provided by the collector or in the exchange data, enter the exact wording in the **Collecting notes** field, and select the corresponding category from the pick list. The following values can be selected from the pick list:

-   Cultivated – the specimen is known to have been grown in cultivation at the collecting site

-   Presumably cultivated – the specimen is presumed to have been cultivated, based species distribution, collecting information (e.g. ‘Ex. horto bot. Berolinensi’) or other information

-   Possibly cultivated – the specimen is thought to have possibly been cultivated, based on species distribution or collecting information

-   Not cultivated – the specimen is known to have not been cultivated

-   Unknown – the cultivated status of the specimen is unknown.

If the **Cultivated status** field is filled in, the cultivated **Source** field must also be completed.

Note that if a plant was collected from the wild and grown on for a brief period of time until it developed features needed for identification, then it should not be considered cultivated. For example, if a liverwort is collected and then left on a windowsill for a week until it has formed antheridia, or if a flowering plant is left in water for a week until its flowers open, then they should not be considered cultivated. Details about how the specimen was treated after being collected from the wild should be entered in the **Collecting notes** field, if provided by the collector, or in the **Miscellaneous notes** field if inferred by the data entry person.

### Cultivated source

The source of the cultivated status. The following values can be selected from the pick list:

-   Collector – the cultivated status was provided by the collector

-   Data entry person – the cultivated status was assessed by the data entry person

-   Exchange data – the cultivated status was provided in the exchange data

-   Label data – the cultivated status appears on the original label, but it’s not clear that it was provided by the collector

-   Other – the cultivated status was assessed by someone else.

### Cultivated status date

The date that the cultivated status was assessed, if known.

### Provenance

The provenance details for cultivated specimens, if provided by the collector. Always enter the site of cultivation as the collecting locality for records of cultivated plants.

## Habitat

### Associated taxa

A list of other plants, algae or fungi growing in association with the specimen. If the collector has provided a distinct list of associated taxa, enter it in the **Associated taxa** field, rather than in the **Habitat** field; if the associated taxa are listed as part of the general habitat description, they can be entered in **Associated taxa**, but should also be included in the full habitat description to avoid losing meaning or context. Where genus names have been abbreviated, and it is clear which genus is being abbreviated, spell them out in full in order to facilitate querying. Any associated species that are included as part of the general habitat description should not be listed in this field. If in doubt, only enter associated taxa if the collector has prefaced the list with ‘associated species’, ‘growing in association with’ or similar wording. Examples of what should be entered in the **Habitat** and **Associated taxa** fields are provided on page 49.

### Host taxon

The taxon name of the host of the specimen, if known. The **Host taxon** field will eventually be linked to the **Taxon** table, but, for now, simply enter the taxon name as a string of text. If the collector has only provided a common name, only add the taxon name if it is unambiguous and easy to determine.

*Note:* If the specimen bears a separate identification for the host taxon of a parasitic plant or fungus, you can just record the determination in the **Miscellaneous notes** field, instead of creating a separate collection object record.

### Common name

The common name of the host, if provided by the collector. Sometimes a brief description of the host will be provided (e.g. ‘some sort of caterpillar’); this information can also be entered in the host **Common name** field.

### Substrate

Information about what the specimen is growing on, if provided by the collector. This field should only be used to record the microhabitat that a cryptogam is growing in; descriptions of the soil or underlying geology of the collecting locality should be included in the habitat description. Examples of what should be entered in the **Habitat**, **Host** and **Substrate** fields are provided below.

### Habitat, Host or Substrate?

| Collecting information | Data entry | Comments |
|------------------------|------------|----------|
| On moss on granite outcrop in scrub. | **Habitat:** On moss on granite outcrop in scrub.<br/><br/>Substrate: moss | Moss needs to be put in the Habitat field as well as in the Substrate field to make it clear that the specimen is not growing directly on the granite outcrop.
| On old bark at base of tree in eucalypt woodland. | Habitat: At base of tree in eucalypt woodland.<br/><br/>Substrate: old bark | It is not clear if the tree is a eucalypt, so don't record eucalypt as the Host common name.
| Beneath leaf litter under Quercus. | Habitat: Beneath leaf litter under Quercus. | An example would be Amanita phalloides growing under an oak. The fungus is mycorrhizal with oak, but mycorrhizal associations should not be recorded in the Host field.
| On the ground amongst litter. | Habitat: On the ground amongst litter. | Ground, or soil, is not a substrate.
| In Eucalyptus woodland, fruiting body growing out of roots of Eucalyptus baxteri. | Habitat: In Eucalyptus woodland.<br/><br/>Substrate: roots
| Host taxon: Eucalyptus baxteri | 
| Growing out of Witchety Grub in Acacia root. | Habitat: In Acacia root.<br/><br/>Host taxon: Xyleutes<br/><br/>Host common name: Witchety Grub | The substrate is what it is growing on, so in this case it could be dead caterpillar, or part of the caterpillar, such as arising from head of caterpillar. Only enter the Host taxon name if there is no ambiguity about what taxon the common name is referring to.
| Growing on Eucalyptus polyanthemos in open eucalypt woodland with grassy understory. | Habitat: Growing on Eucalyptus polyanthemos in open eucalypt woodland with grassy understory.<br/><br/>Host taxon: Eucalyptus polyanthemos | If a plant is parasitic, its host should be recorded in the Host taxon field, not in Substrate.
| Growing on sandy soil derived from granite. | Habitat: Sandy soil derived from granite. | Soil information should not be included in substrate.
