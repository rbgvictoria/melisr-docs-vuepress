<p>Information about herbarium transactions is recorded in the <strong>Interactions</strong> module in Specify. Two separate collections are used to record details of MEL transactions: outgoing loans, donations and exchange are recorded in the <em>National Herbarium of Victoria</em> collection, and incoming loans are recorded in the <em>Non-MEL loans</em> collection.</p> <h2 id="loans"><a href="#loans" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Loans</h2> <p>In MELISR, loans of MEL specimens to other institutions are recorded in the <strong>Loan</strong> table. The Loan table has two views: <strong>Loan</strong> and <strong>Loan w/o preps</strong>. The <strong>Loan w/o preps</strong> table allows you to enter data about the loan before specifying which specimens will be part of the loan. See the <strong>Databasing loans</strong> (p. 120) section for more information on how to use the two loan views.</p> <h3 id="loan-form"><a href="#loan-form" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Loan form</h3> <h4 id="loan"><a href="#loan" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Loan</h4> <h5 id="loan-number"><a href="#loan-number" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Loan number</h5> <p>The MEL loan number comprises two parts, separated by a forward slash:</p> <ul><li>Year – the year the loan was prepared</li> <li>Number – a sequential, four-digit number. The sequence restarts at 0001 each year.</li></ul> <p>Old loan numbers have been converted to this format based on the year they were sent out (e.g. MEL loan 210 = 1974/0210).</p> <p>This field fills automatically when the loan record is saved; however, the loan number needs to be entered manually for the first loan in each calendar year and for transferred loans.</p> <p>Note that the abbreviation for the recipient institution (e.g. CANB) appears after the loan number but is not part of the loan number. The abbreviation is taken from the institution in the <strong>Sent to</strong> field when the record is saved.</p> <h5 id="loan-status"><a href="#loan-status" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Loan status</h5> <p>The current status of the loan. The following values can be selected from the pick list:</p> <ul><li>Awaiting acknowledgement – loan has been sent, but the yellow acknowledgement form has not been received at MEL</li> <li>Complete – all loan preparations have been returned to MEL (or transferred to another institution)</li> <li>Current – all or some preparations are still on loan</li> <li>New – the loan is being prepared</li> <li>Not serviced – the loan request was received but not serviced</li> <li>Written off – the loan has been closed because the specimens have been lost or destroyed.</li></ul> <h5 id="quantity-on-loan"><a href="#quantity-on-loan" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Quantity on loan</h5> <p>The number of preparations that are on loan.

For loans where an extension has been granted, the <strong>Current due date</strong> should be updated.</p> <h5 id="extension-granted"><a href="#extension-granted" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Extension granted</h5> <p>A check box indicating if an extension has been granted. The new due date should be recorded in <strong>Current due date</strong>. Details of who granted the extension and the date are recorded in the <strong>Description</strong> field, and should be prefixed by a double pipe (||).</p> <h5 id="original-due-date"><a href="#original-due-date" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Original due date</h5> <p>The date by which the loan was originally due to be returned to MEL. For loans where no extension has been granted, the <strong>Original due date</strong> will be the same as the <strong>Current due date</strong>.</p> <h5 id="description"><a href="#description" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Description</h5> <p>A short summary of the contents of loan. For example:</p> <ul><li><em>‘Utricularia</em> specimens set aside during visit to MEL on 13 Sep 2010’</li> <li>‘Selected Victorian specimens of <em>Epacris impressa’</em>.</li></ul> <p>This description appears on the loan paperwork. Subsequent comments should be prefixed by a double pipe ( ‘||’), for example:</p> <ul><li>‘Selected Victorian specimens of <em>Epacris impressa.</em> || Extension granted by J.Smith, 4/4/2011.’</li></ul> <h5 id="project"><a href="#project" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Project</h5> <p>This field is used to indicate if a loan was requested for a particular project. ‘Flora of Australia Project’ is currently the only project in the pick list.</p> <h5 id="destructive-sampling-permitted"><a href="#destructive-sampling-permitted" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Destructive sampling permitted</h5> <p>A check box to indicate if destructive sampling has been approved (either at the time the loan was prepared, or subsequently). Details of destructive sampling permission should be included in <strong>Conditions</strong>.</p> <h5 id="conditions"><a href="#conditions" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Conditions</h5> <p>Any conditions other than the standard MEL loan conditions, such as details of permission for destructive sampling to be undertaken.</p> <h5 id="acknowledged"><a href="#acknowledged" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Acknowledged</h5> <p>The date of receipt of the loan at the receiving institution (as recorded on the yellow acknowledgement slip).</p> <h5 id="received-comments"><a href="#received-comments" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Received comments</h5> <p>Comments noted by the receiving institution on the yellow acknowledgement slip (e.g. damage to specimen(s), discrepancies between specimens sent and loan list).</p> <h5 id="loan-notice"><a href="#loan-notice" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Loan notice</h5> <p>Details of the most recent notice sent to the receiving institution regarding the loan. Details of previous notices are recorded in the <strong>Description</strong> field, prefixed by a double pipe (‘||’). The following values can be selected from the pick list:</p> <ul><li>Acknowledgement request</li> <li>Extension</li> <li>Overdue</li> <li>Recall</li> <li>Reminder.</li></ul> <h5 id="notice-sent"><a href="#notice-sent" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Notice sent</h5> <p>The date on which the most recent notice was sent to the receiving institution.</p> <h5 id="loan-closed"><a href="#loan-closed" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Loan closed</h5> <p>The date on which all loaned specimens are processed as returned. For full loan transfers, this is the date on which the loan is acknowledged as received by the institution to which it was transferred.</p> <h5 id="loan-transfer-no"><a href="#loan-transfer-no" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Loan transfer no.</h5> <p>For transferred loans (full or partial), the loan number to which the loan has been transferred. For loan transfers, the year and number components stay the same, but the institution code changes to that of the institution to which the loan has been transferred. For example, if loan 1974/0210 CANB is transferred to AD, the transferred loan number is 1974/0210 AD.</p> <h4 id="loan-agents"><a href="#loan-agents" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Loan agents</h4> <h5 id="name"><a href="#name" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Name</h5> <p>The botanist(s) and/or student(s) on behalf of whom the loan was requested. A loan may have multiple loan agents (e.g. student and supervisor(s)).</p> <h5 id="role"><a href="#role" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Role</h5> <p>The role of the agent in the loan. The following values can be selected from the pick list:</p> <ul><li>Botanist</li> <li>Other</li> <li>Student</li> <li>Supervisor.</li></ul> <h4 id="shipments"><a href="#shipments" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Shipments</h4> <h5 id="sent-to"><a href="#sent-to" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Sent to</h5> <p>The institution to which the loan was sent. This corresponds to <strong>Last name</strong> in the <strong>Agent</strong> table and is formatted as the herbarium code followed by ‘ -- ‘ then the title of the institution (e.g. CANB -- Australian National Herbarium). If the institution is in the <strong>Agent</strong> table, but is not formatted as above, please edit the <strong>Agent</strong> record first.</p> <h5 id="shipment-number"><a href="#shipment-number" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Shipment number</h5> <p>An auto-generated identifier for the shipment.</p> <h5 id="date-sent"><a href="#date-sent" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Date sent</h5> <p>The date the loan was prepared for dispatch. This date prints on the loan paperwork.</p> <h5 id="prepared-by"><a href="#prepared-by" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Prepared by</h5> <p>The Curation Officer(s) who prepared the loan. This prints on the loan paperwork. If the consignment was prepared by more than one Curation Officer, they should be entered as a ‘Group’ agent (see ‘<strong>Group’ agents</strong>, p. 92).</p> <h5 id="method"><a href="#method" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Method</h5> <p>The method by which the loan was shipped.
